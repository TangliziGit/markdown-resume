## Internship Experience

=== <strong>Beijing ByteDance Technology Co., Ltd.</strong> || 2021/05 - 2021/08 ===
=== <small>International E-commerce - Promotion Center Back-end R&D Intern</small> || <small>Beijing</small> ===

<->
Magellan Promotion Center is for international users and is responsible for the approval and pricing of promotions such as coupons.

- To solve the problem of status inconsistency between the approval process platform and back-end database, designed and implemented an <u>approval process synchronization bot</u>. The scheme ensures idempotency and can be extended to various promotions.
- To improve the unit test coverage after service classification, designed a <u>mocking scheme and investigated testing frameworks</u>. The mocking scheme can cover scenarios such as cache, databases, and downstream responses. It can combine the testing framework and logs to increase the coverage of a single service to 60%+ within 2~3 days.

=== <strong>Chaos Mesh Open Source Community</strong> || 2021/09 - 2021/12 ===
=== <small>CNCF LFX Mentee</small> || <small>Remote Internship</small> ===

<->
Chaos Mesh is a chaos engineering platform that simulates various faults in production and discovers potential problems.
The platform defines chaos experiments through CRD to inject corresponding faults into the containers in the cluster through technologies such as namespace and sidecar.

- In order to improve the observability, 16 <u>metrics</u> were designed and collected, such as iptables, tc, and other rules in the target container. And proposed monitoring dashboard deployment and expansion methods.


## Project Experience

=== <strong>DevOps Platform Maintenance</strong> || 2021/10 - Now ===
=== <small>Team Leader</small> || <small>Nanjing University - Lab Work</small> ===

<->
The platform integrates the DevOps toolchain to provide research projects with the ability to visualize editing of pipeline configurations and automatically deploy applications.
The project is deployed in Kubernetes, including 17 microservices, with a total of 300+ APIs.

- For the first time, the platform was deployed in the laboratory computer room. We found problems such as collaboration and code quality were found through documents, code, and communication with the seniors. And improving code quality and observability while bringing the smallest usable system online.
- Responsible for maintaining server security and fundamental software such as Kubernetes and transparent proxy.

=== <strong>A BaaS platform based on smart contract microservices</strong> || 2021/02 - 2021/05 ===
=== <small>Team Leader</small> || <small>Northwestern Polytechnical University - Undergraduate Design</small> ===

<->
The BaaS platform is implemented based on the open-source blockchain framework, using smart contracts as microservices, and improving development efficiency with DevOps toolchains.

- Responsible for implementing the state maintenance of the Pod instances, and fast blockchain network and chaincodes deployment.
- Quickly read prototype papers, learnt blockchain framework Hyperledger Fabric and Kubernetes technology in two months. And completed system design and implementation in three months.
